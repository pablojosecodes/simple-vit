Just some practice replicating a paper in Pytorch

Paper replicated: Originial Vision Transformer Paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929v2)

# Classes

- `Attention`
- `FeedForward`
- `Transformer`
- `ViT`

# Saved Model

You can access the trained model weights (just trained on MNIST) [here](https://huggingface.co/pablojosecodes/basic_vision_transformer/commit/a11c10b85889eb249a1cf446f2722642cd11dabb)
